# 1. Introduction & Basic Neurobiology (Rajesh Rao)

## 1.1. Course Introduction

<aside>
💡 descriptive model, mechanistic model, interpretive model

</aside>

- Three levels of computational models to understand the brain
    - Descriptive model (what; implementation)
    - Mechanistic model (how; algorithm)
    - Interpretive model (why; computation)
- Two main textbooks
    - Dayan & Abbot. Theoretical Neuroscience: Computational and Mathematical Modeling of Neural Systems. 2001.
    - Anastasio. Tutorial on Neural Systems Modelling. 2010.

## 1.2. Computational Neuroscience: Descriptive Models

<aside>
💡 receptive field

</aside>

- What is computational neuroscience?
    - “The goal of computational neuroscience is to explain in computational terms how brains generate behaviors” (T. Sejnowski)
    - Computational neuroscience provides tools and methods for “characterizing what nervous systems do, determining how they function, and understanding why they operate in particular ways” (P. Dayan and L. Abbott)
- Hubel, D. H., & Wiesel, T. N. (1965). Receptive fields and functional architecture in two nonstriate visual areas (18 and 19) of the cat. *Journal of Neurophysiology*, *28*(2), 229-289.

## 1.3. Computational Neuroscience: Mechanistic and Interpretive Models

<aside>
💡 efficient coding hypothesis

</aside>

- Efficient coding algorithms: Sparse coding, ICA, predictive coding

## 1.4. The Electrical Personality of Neurons

<aside>
💡 neuron doctrine, cell membrane, ion channel, membrane potential, ionic pump, depolarization, hyperpolarization, action potential, resting potential, myelination

</aside>

- Neuron doctrine
    1. The neuron is the fundamental structural & functional unit of the brain.
    2. Neurons are discrete cells and not continuous with other cells.
    3. Information flows from the dendrites to the axon via the cell body.
- Ion channels are voltage-gated, chemically-gated, or mechanically-gated.

## 1.5. Making Connections: Synapses

<aside>
💡 [electrical/chemical][excitatory/inhibitory] synapse, synapse doctrine, excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), Hebbian plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)

</aside>

- Hebbian plasticity
    - If neuron A repeatedly takes part in firing neuron B, then the synapse from A to B is strengthened.
- [STDP] Bi, G. Q., & Poo, M. M. (1998). Synaptic modifications in cultured hippocampal neurons: dependence on spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type. *Journal of neuroscience*, *18*(24), 10464-10472.

## 1.6. Time to Network: Brain Areas and their Function

<aside>
💡 [somatic/autonomic] peripheral nervous system (PNS), central nervous system (CNS), brain, spinal cord, hindbrain, medulla oblongata, pons, cerebellum, midbrain, reticular formation, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebrum, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala
