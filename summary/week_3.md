- **Detection theory**Â orÂ **signal detection theory**Â is a means to measure the ability to differentiate between information-bearing patterns (calledÂ stimulusÂ in living organisms,Â signalÂ in machines) and random patterns that distract from the information (calledÂ noise). From Wikipedia.

- **Population coding** is a method to represent signals by the joint activities of a number of neurons. In population coding, each neuron has a distribution of responses over some set of inputs, and the responses of many neurons may be combined to determine the value about the inputs.

ðŸ’¡ Gaussian, central limit theorem

- When not to use Gaussians
    - True distribution is bimodal.
    - True distribution is over small integers.
    - True distribution is over strictly positives.
