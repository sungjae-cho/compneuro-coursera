## 8.S1. Eb Fetz on Bidirectional Brain-Computer Interfaces

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ bidirectional brain-computer interface

</aside>

- The concept of bidirectional brain-computer interfaces, which can both record from and stimulate neurons at the same time.
- The artificial bidirectional chip has bidirectional connections between the brain cortex and either spinal cords or muscles.
- Bidirectional BCIs: Two types of applications
    1. Create artificial recurrent connections. The brain adapts to consistent sensorimotor conditions and could learn to incorporate the bidirectional BCI.
    2. Create synaptic (Hebbian) plasticity. Spike-triggered stimulation strengthens synaptic connections.
- Two studies on the bidirectional BCIs
